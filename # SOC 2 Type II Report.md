SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls Type 2) analysis and report for an enterprise-grade platform like Visible Light or any SaaS/CloudOps system is a comprehensive, auditor-verified review of how your company manages data security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

Below is a full breakdown of what an enterprise-level SOC 2 engagement would include‚Äîfrom scoping to final deliverables.

üß≠ 1. Scope & Readiness Assessment
a. Trust Services Criteria (TSC) Selection

You select which of the five TSCs apply to your environment:

TSC	Purpose
Security (Mandatory)	Protection against unauthorized access and breaches
Availability	Ensures systems are operational and resilient
Processing Integrity	Data processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized
Confidentiality	Sensitive data is protected
Privacy	Personal information is collected, used, and retained appropriately

For most SaaS / AI platforms: Security, Availability, and Confidentiality are baseline.

üß© 2. System Description (‚ÄúSection 3 Narrative‚Äù)

Auditors require a comprehensive, management-prepared description of your system.
This is the backbone of the SOC 2 report.

Contents:

Company overview: mission, ownership, organizational structure

Services in scope: (e.g., Visible Light Hub, Luna AI, Supercluster Console)

Infrastructure: servers, databases, APIs, endpoints, networks, geographic footprint

Software components: application architecture, microservices, dependencies

Data flows: from client ingestion (WP plugin, connectors) through internal processing

Personnel: roles and responsibilities for IT, DevOps, and compliance

Subservice organizations: vendors like AWS, Cloudflare, Auth0, OpenAI, Mailchimp, etc.

Control boundaries: what‚Äôs managed internally vs. by subservice providers

Incident response & business continuity processes

üß± 3. Control Environment Documentation

A detailed inventory of policies, procedures, and technical safeguards.

Key domains:

Domain	Example Controls
Governance & Risk Management	Security policy approvals, annual reviews, risk registers
Access Control	MFA enforcement, least-privilege reviews, SSO via Auth0
Change Management	GitHub PR workflows, code review, deployment logs
System Monitoring	Cloudflare WAF, AWS CloudWatch, SIEM alerts
Incident Response	Playbooks, alert escalation, breach notification process
Vendor Management	DPA reviews, risk scoring, compliance evidence for subservice orgs
Data Encryption	TLS 1.3, AES-256 at rest, KMS key rotation
Backup & Recovery	Offsite encrypted backups, RTO/RPO objectives
Employee Onboarding/Offboarding	Background checks, immediate access revocation
Privacy & GDPR Alignment	Consent scripts, data retention, data subject rights handling
üîç 4. Control Design & Operating Effectiveness (Testing)

The auditor tests whether your controls are:

Designed effectively (Type 1)

Operating effectively over time (Type 2 ‚Äì usually 6‚Äì12 months)

Evidence Collection Includes:

Firewall & access logs

Cloud configuration screenshots

Penetration test results

Employee training records

Policy acknowledgment forms

Ticketing evidence for change control

SIEM alerts and incident reports

Vendor SOC2/ISO27001 attestations

üìä 5. Risk Assessment & Gap Analysis (Pre-Audit)

Before formal audit:

Perform a Readiness Assessment

Identify control gaps (e.g., missing MFA enforcement, incomplete incident logs)

Develop Remediation Plans

Establish a Control Matrix mapping policies ‚Üí controls ‚Üí evidence ‚Üí TSCs

Deliverable:

‚úÖ SOC 2 Readiness Report (internal use only)

üßæ 6. Auditor‚Äôs Report Structure (Final Deliverable)

A SOC 2 Type II Report has five main sections:

Independent Service Auditor‚Äôs Report

Opinion on whether controls were suitably designed and operating effectively.

May include qualified or unqualified (clean) opinion.

Management Assertion

Signed statement from your executives asserting the description‚Äôs accuracy.

System Description

Detailed narrative (see Section 2).

Controls and Tests of Operating Effectiveness

Auditor‚Äôs testing procedures, evidence, and results.

Other Information (Optional)

Management responses, complementary user entity controls, subservice org disclosures.

üß† 7. Supporting Artifacts (Enterprise-Grade Add-Ons)

Large SaaS companies typically supplement SOC 2 with:

Penetration Testing Report (external vendor)

Vulnerability Management Summary

Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

Data Flow Diagrams (Visio / Lucidchart)

Asset Inventory and CMDB exports

GDPR / HIPAA crosswalk mapping

Employee Security Awareness Training evidence

Vendor Risk Management Dashboard

Audit Log Exports (SIEM/Splunk)

üßÆ 8. Timeline & Effort
Phase	Duration	Deliverable
Readiness & Scoping	4‚Äì6 weeks	Gap analysis & roadmap
Remediation	4‚Äì12 weeks	Policy, control, or infra updates
Observation Period	3‚Äì12 months	Evidence collection
Audit Fieldwork	2‚Äì4 weeks	Auditor testing
Reporting	2 weeks	Final SOC 2 Type II report
üß© 9. Integration for Ongoing Compliance

Enterprise SOC 2 programs are continuous:

Automated evidence collection (Drata, Vanta, Tugboat Logic)

Quarterly control testing

Annual renewal of SOC 2 Type II

Cross-alignment with ISO 27001, GDPR, and CCPA

Security posture dashboards (e.g., via AWS Security Hub or custom SIEM)

üèÅ 10. Example Deliverables Package (Enterprise)

Included in the SOC 2 Report Binder:

Executive Summary

Scope Statement

System Overview

Control Matrix (TSC ‚Üí Controls ‚Üí Evidence)

Risk Assessment Matrix

Auditor Testing Summary

Management Response

Clean Opinion Letter

Appendices (vendor attestations, network topology diagrams, policies)
